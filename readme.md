# Calorie Counter

## Description
The Calorie Counter project is a web application designed to help users track their daily calorie intake and expenditure. Users can input their budgeted calorie allowance and log the calories consumed and burned through various meals and exercises. The application then calculates the remaining calorie balance and provides feedback on whether the user is in a calorie surplus or deficit.

This project is based on the tutorial available on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). It serves as a practical exercise for learning JavaScript DOM manipulation and form handling. The project can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/)

## Features
- Allows users to input their daily calorie budget.
- Enables users to add entries for meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and exercises.
- Automatically calculates the remaining calorie balance.
- Provides feedback on whether the user is in a calorie surplus or deficit.
